# Diving App

## Introduction
This app was made to solve the problem of my wife needing a quick way to calculate scores from dives and track the divers during dive meets when there wasn't a screen or board to show results. This app is the solution to that as it allows her to quickly track scores and keep track of placement of each divers in an easy to use app. There are more features coming soon which will allow her and others to get statistics within a dive season. 

## Continuous Updates
This app is continually being updated with features and UI issues that can make the users experience better. If you have any feedback feel free to email me (joshua.andersland@gmail.com) or send a pull request. 

## Planned Future updates
Not in any order: 
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Profile section to track and look at stats within the dive season
- Change the dive meet section to upload a dive season calender to use
- change the dive meet section to input an exhibition event or non scheduled event
